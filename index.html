<h1>Natural Law for Human Freedom</h1>
<h3><b>Morality is objective.</b></h3>
<h4>Just as law of physics govern the cause and effect in physical reality, natural law (moral law, universal law, god's law, etc.) governs
cause and effect for human behavior.</h4>

<h4><b>Feminine Principle of Natural Law: Do not harm others.</b></h4>
<h5>All violations of natural law (harm to others) can be considered theft at the core. Natural rights are property rights.<h5>

<h1><b>Masculine Principle of Natural Law: Protect yourself and others.</h1>
<h5>Consider the 2nd Amendment of the US Constitution.</h5>

<h1><b>The Trivium is method of objective truth seeking.</h1>
<h4>The trivium is as old as existence itself.</h4>
<h4><b>Knowledge -> Understanding -> Wisdom</b></h4>
<h4>It is the function of consciousness: thought, emotion, and action.</h4>
<h4>To be truly free, our thoughts, emotions, and actions must align with natural, and they must not contradict.</h4> 
<h4>The trivium is part of the 7 liberal arts in the form of Grammar, Logic, and Rhetoric.</h4>
<h4>The 7 liberal arts includes the Trivium and the Quadrivium: arithmetic, geometry, music, and geometry.</h4>
<h5>Study the Pythagorean triangle to understand how the 5 senses interact with the Trivium and the Quadrivium.</h5> 

<h1><b>Humanity is in condition of slavery.<b></h1>
<h4>The Unholy Trinity contains the <b></b>3 major forces enslaving humanity today:</b></h4>

<h4>Father: <b>Religion</b></h4> 
<h5>Guilt</h5>

<h4>Mother: <b>Money</b></h4>
<h5>Shame</h5>

<h4>Son: <b>Government</b></h4>
<h5>Fear</h5>
